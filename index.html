            <p>Over the past three months, we’ve helped local authorities and NHS partners with their immediate response to the COVID-19 crisis. As we begin to understand the longer term implications of the pandemic, <strong>we wanted to share what we’ve been doing and what we’ve learnt</strong>.</p>
            <p>We’re now supporting public sector institutions to reimagine future approaches to public service delivery. Through new operating and organising models to build resilient, regenerative communities, we want to <strong>help you shape the future of your places</strong>.</p>
