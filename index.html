            <p>Over the past two months, we’ve helped local authorities and NHS partners with their immediate response to the COVID-19 crisis. As we begin to understand the longer term implications of the pandemic, we wanted to share what we’ve been doing, what we’ve learnt and <strong>how it might work for you</strong>.</p>
            <p>We’re supporting public sector institutions to reimagine. Working together and thinking differently in the face of uncertainty, to emerge from this crisis with new operating and organising models that help us build resilient, regenerative communities and <strong>shape the future of our places</strong>.</p>
